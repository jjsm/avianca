2. Create 2 Tablespaces:
    a. first one with 2 Gb and 1 datafile, tablespace should be named "avianca":
    CREATE TABLESPACE avianca DATAFILE 'df_avianca.dbf' SIZE 2000M; 

    b. Undo tablespace with 25Mb of space and 1 datafile:
    CREATE UNDO TABLESPACE undo_avianca DATAFILE 'undo_df_avianca.dbf'  SIZE 25M;

3. Set the undo tablespace to be used in the system:
ALTER SYSTEM SET UNDO_TABLESPACE = undo_avianca;

4. Create a DBA user (with the role DBA) and assign it to the tablespace called "avianca", this user has unlimited space on the tablespace (The user should have permission to connect) (0.125)

    CREATE USER admin_dba IDENTIFIED by oracle DEFAULT TABLESPACE avianca;
    CREATE ROLE DBA;
    GRANT UNLIMITED TABLESPACE, DBA, CONNECT TO DBA;
    GRANT DBA TO admin_dba;


5. Create 2 profiles. 

    a.	Profile 1: "clerk" password life 40 days, one session per user, 10 minutes idle, 4 failed login attempts 
        
        create profile clerk LIMIT
        PASSWORD_LIFE_TIME 40
        sessions_per_user  1
        idle_time 10
        failed_login_attempts 4

    b.	Profile 2: "development" password life 100 days, two session per user, 30 minutes idle, no failed login attempts
        
        create profile development LIMIT
        PASSWORD_LIFE_TIME 100
        sessions_per_user  2
        idle_time 30

6. Create 4 users, assign them the tablespace "avianca"; 2 of them should have the clerk profile and the remaining the development profile, all the users should be allow to connect to the database. 
    
    CREATE USER jhon 
    IDENTIFIED by oracle 
    DEFAULT TABLESPACE avianca
    QUOTA UNLIMITED ON avianca
    PROFILE clerk;

    CREATE USER andres 
    IDENTIFIED by oracle 
    DEFAULT TABLESPACE avianca
    QUOTA UNLIMITED ON avianca
    PROFILE clerk;

    CREATE USER edward 
    IDENTIFIED by oracle 
    DEFAULT TABLESPACE avianca
    QUOTA UNLIMITED ON avianca
    PROFILE development;

    CREATE USER brallan 
    IDENTIFIED by oracle 
    DEFAULT TABLESPACE avianca
    QUOTA UNLIMITED ON avianca
    PROFILE development;

    GRANT  CONNECT TO brallan, Edward, andres,jhon;

7. Lock one user associate with clerk profile 
    
    ALTER USER andres ACCOUNT LOCK;
